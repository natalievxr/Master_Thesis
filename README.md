# Master_Thesis
## Overview
This study investigates agentic AI in three distinct negotiation roles: replacement, support, and undermine. Using simulated corporate HR negotiations (*N=43*), we assessed AI performance, participant behaviour, and system vulnerabilities. 

# Repository Structure
#### 📁 Materials
* AWS Bedrock: Guide for replacement participants (Amazon Bedrock login).

* CONSENT FORM: Participant agreement form.

* Read this first: Negotiaton guidelines.

#### 📁 Replacement
* Contains all conversation logs between participants and the replacement AI.

#### 📁 Results
* Output files from Efficiency file.

#### 📁 US_Data
* Conversations from undermine and support participants, used in Efficiency file.

### Code Files
#### Efficiency.ipynb
* Calculates negotiation efficiency (token counts, turns).

#### 📊 Data Analysis.ipynb
* Analyses Likert-scale survey responses.
  
Inputs: R data.csv, s data.csv, u data.csv (participant responses).

### 📂 CSV Files
* R data.csv, s data.csv, u data.csv: Raw survey data for replacement, support, and undermine conditions.
